## Kenoovo 280x280mm (600W) & Thermal Fuse (125c) URL: https://keenovo.store/products/keenovo-square-silicone-heater-3d-printer-build-plate-heatbed-heating-pad?variant=12592089268279
## Build plate is 10mm thick; Width 304.8mm (12 inches); Height: 304.8mm (12 inches)
## Heater Max = 30.48cm x 30.48cm = 929.0304 * 0.4Watts/cm2 = 371.61216, I own a 600Watt heater which means Max_Power = 371.61216 / 600 = 0.6193536 or 0.62
##  SSR Pin - BED_OUT
##  Thermistor - TB
heater_pin: PA1
## Check what thermistor type you have. See https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#common-thermistors for common thermistor types.
## Use "Generic 3950" for Keenovo heaters
sensor_type: keenovo #Generic 3950
sensor_pin: PF3
##  Adjust Max Power so your heater doesn't warp your bed. Rule of thumb is 0.4 watts / cm^2 .
max_power: 0.6
min_temp: 0 #-273.15
#max_temp: 120                                          #   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< overridden by FILAMENT_FilE.cfg  <<<
##control: pid                            # PID tuning  #   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< overridden by FILAMENT_FilE.cfg  <<<
##pid_Kp: 13.211                          # No Overshoot#   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< overridden by FILAMENT_FilE.cfg  <<<
##pid_Ki: 0.339                           # No Overshoot#   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< overridden by FILAMENT_FilE.cfg  <<<
##pid_Kd: 340.046                         # No Overshoot#   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< overridden by FILAMENT_FilE.cfg  <<<
##To calculate the "No Overshoot" PID from the "classic PID" parameters - 
##divide the recommended Kp by 3, 
##divide Ki by 3, and 
##multiply Kd by 0.88
#
## un-comment the next 4 lines when you want to do a PID Tune of the heater_bed.  comment out the same lines in the FILAMENT_FILE.cfg file.  
##This way Klipper will perform the SAVE_CONFIG without error.
#control: pid                          # PID tuning 
#pid_kp = 39.632                       # Classic PID
#pid_ki = 1.016                        # Classic PID
#pid_kd = 386.416                      # Classic PID
#
## comment out the pwm_cycle_time when you want to do a PID Tune of the heater_bed.
##This way Klipper will perform the SAVE_CONFIG without error.

[verify_heater heater_bed]
max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
check_gain_time: 60
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating. Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 2.
